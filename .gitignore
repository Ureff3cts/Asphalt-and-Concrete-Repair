# a Gemfile as specified at https://github.com/github/pages-gem#conventional

# Basic Jekyll gitignores (synchronize to Jekyll.gitignore)
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Additional Ruby/bundler ignore for when you run: bundle install
/vendor

# Specific ignore for GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages will always use its own deployed version of pages-gem 
# This means GitHub Pages will NOT use your Gemfile.lock and therefore it is
# counterproductive to check this file into the repository.
